# Growth Mindset

## what is a **growth mindset** ?
  A **growth mindset** is to believe that `you can always change for the better` and you’re always capable of self-improvement as long as you’re willing to keep trying and love what you’re doing
  
## Reminders to keep a **growth mindset**:
1.	take the `time` to assess what ive been doing repeatedly and thinking of ways to make it more challenging and therefor more rewarding. 
1.	Reading and trying `new ways` and things
1. 	Practice `problem` solving and `critical` thinking.
