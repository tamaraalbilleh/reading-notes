# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
* Google’s most effective teams :were composed of friends who socialized outside work.
* Others were made up of people who were basically strangers away from the conference room.
* Some groups sought strong managers. Others preferred a less hierarchical structure.
* `‘‘group norms.’’` Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather: One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate; another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink.
* Some groups said that teammates interrupted one another constantly and that team leaders reinforced that behavior by interrupting others themselves.
* other teams, leaders enforced conversational order, and when someone cut off a teammate, group members would politely ask everyone to wait his or her turn.
*  There were teams that contained outsize personalities who hewed to their group’s sedate norms, and others in which introverts came out of their shells as soon as meetings began.
* the researchers wanted to know if there is a collective I. Q. that emerges within a team that is distinct from the smarts of any single member.
* To accomplish this, the researchers recruited 699 people, divided them into small groups and gave each a series of assignments that required different kinds of cooperation.
*  teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. 
* the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues
* companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really be optimized.
