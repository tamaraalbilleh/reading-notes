### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. 
* **rather than repeating** the same set of statements ,If different parts of a script **repeat** the same task, you can
reuse the function
*  helps organize your code. 
* it stores the statement so they wont always be executed when the page loads .
* calling the function = naming the function a meaningful name 
* code blocks must be contained in curly braces 
* some functions need to be provided with additional info like **parameters**

### Declaring a Function
* to create a function, you give it a name and then write the statments needed to achieve it's task inside the curly braces.
* **this is called a function declaration**

### Calling a Function
* having ddeclared the function, you can then excute all of the statments between its curly braces with just one line of code.
* **this is called calling the function**

### Declaring the function that need information 
* Sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task. In such cases, when you declare the function you give it parameters. Inside the function, the parameters act like variables.

### CALLING FUNCTIONS THAT NEED INFORMATION 
* When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called arguments, and they can be provided as values or as variables. 
###
### geeting a single value out of a function
* some functions return information to the code that called them.
for example : when they perform calculations they return the results.
