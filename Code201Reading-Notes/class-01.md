## chapter 17 HTML5 Layout
### Traditional HTML Layouts
web page authors used `<div>` elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the `<div>` element in the structure of the page. 
### New Html5 Layout Elements
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.
### Headers & Footers
The `<header>` and `<footer>` elements can be used for:
* The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site
* A header or footer for an individual `<article>` or `<section>` within the page

### Navigation
The `<nav>` element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

### Articles
The `<article>` element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and  potentially be syndicated.

### Asides
The `<aside>` element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an `<article>` element or not
![8](https://github.com/tamaraalbilleh/reading-notes/blob/main/Code102Reading-Notes/8.PNG?raw=true)
### Sections
The `<section>` element groups related content together, and typically, each section would have its own heading.
### Heading Groups 
The purpose of the `<hgroup>` element is to group together a set of one or more `<h1>` through `<h6>` elements so that they are treated as one single heading
![9](https://github.com/tamaraalbilleh/reading-notes/blob/main/Code102Reading-Notes/9.PNG?raw=true)
### Figures
It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).

### Sectioning Elements
It may seem strange to follow these new elements by revisiting the `<div>` element again. (After all, the new elements are often going to be used in its place.
### Linking Around Block-Level Elements
HTML5 allows web page authors to place an <a> element around a block level element that contains child elements. This allows you to turn an entire block into a link.
> The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple `<div>` elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google



## chapter 18 Process & Design

### Who is the Site for?
Every website should be designed for the target audience 
### Why People Visit YOUR Website?
While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.
Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users
### What Your Visitors Are Trying to Achieve?
Look for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs
### What Information Your Visitors Need?
Your website needs to contain information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively
### How Often People Will Visit Your Site?
Some sites benefit from being updated more
frequently than others so update regularly as needed.
### Site Maps
Organizing the information into sections or pages.
![3](https://github.com/tamaraalbilleh/reading-notes/blob/main/Code102Reading-Notes/3.PNG?raw=true)
### Wireframes
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
![4](https://github.com/tamaraalbilleh/reading-notes/blob/main/Code102Reading-Notes/4.PNG?raw=true)
### Getting your message across using design
Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.
### Visual hierarchy
use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.
### grouping and Similarity 
organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend.
### Designing Navigation 
Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go.
* It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them
* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present

## chapter 8 Extra Markup
![11](https://github.com/tamaraalbilleh/reading-notes/blob/main/Code102Reading-Notes/11.PNG?raw=true)
DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the
`<!-- and -->` markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* `<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©
## chapter 1 Structur
* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround  special meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

# Duckett JS book
## Chapter 1 The ABC of Programming
### what is a script and how do i creat one ?
* A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal
* scripts are made of instructions a computer can follow step by step
* browsers use diffirent parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page.
* scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them 
#### WRITING ASCRIPT
* To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it
* Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps. 
* 1.  DEFINE THE GOAL 
1. DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
1. CODE EACH STEP
![a1](https://github.com/tamaraalbilleh/reading-notes/blob/main/Code102Reading-Notes/a1.PNG?raw=true)
#### DEFINING A GOAL & DESIGNING THE SCRIPT
* Consider how you might approach a different type of script.
#### SKETCHING OUT THE TASKS IN A FLOWCHART
* Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations.
* You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together.
* The flowcharts show the paths between each step. 
![aa1](https://github.com/tamaraalbilleh/reading-notes/blob/main/Code102Reading-Notes/aa1.PNG?raw=true)
## SUMMARY
* A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help)
***

## Expressions 
* An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking 
*there are two types of expressions. :
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
> var color = 'beige'; 
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE
> var area = 3 * 2; 
***

## Operators 
* Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 
2. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 
> color = 'beige';
2. COMPARISON OPERATORS
> buy = 3 > 5; 
2. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS 
> area = 3 * 2;
![aa2](https://github.com/tamaraalbilleh/reading-notes/blob/main/Code102Reading-Notes/aa2.PNG?raw=true)
2. STRING OPERATORS
> greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';
* There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
* It is used to join the strings on either side of it
> var firstName = 'Ivy ' ;
> var lastName = ' Stone' ;
> var ful l Name = f irstName + l astName ; 
![aa3](https://github.com/tamaraalbilleh/reading-notes/blob/main/Code102Reading-Notes/aa3.PNG?raw=true)
2. LOGICAL OPERATORS
buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);
***

## Function
### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
### A BASIC FUNCTION

![aa5](https://github.com/tamaraalbilleh/reading-notes/blob/main/Code102Reading-Notes/aa5.PNG?raw=true)
***
### Declaring a function 
3. declare the function using the function keyword 
3. give it a name 
3. define the statment that perform the task sit in a code block inside curly bracets.
![aa6](https://github.com/tamaraalbilleh/reading-notes/blob/main/Code102Reading-Notes/aa6.PNG?raw=true)
### Calling a function 
* you can excute all the statments between its curly braces with one line only.
![aa7](https://github.com/tamaraalbilleh/reading-notes/blob/main/Code102Reading-Notes/aa7.PNG?raw=true)
### declaring functions that need info
4. declare the function using the function keyword 
4.  give it parameters ( acts like variables inside the function )
![aa8](https://github.com/tamaraalbilleh/reading-notes/blob/main/Code102Reading-Notes/aa8.PNG?raw=true)
### calling functions that need info
* when you call a function that has parameters,specify the values it should use in the parantheses that follow it's name.
* the values are called arguments  and they can be provided as **values** or as **variables**.
### getting a single value out of a function
* some functions return info to the code that called them.
