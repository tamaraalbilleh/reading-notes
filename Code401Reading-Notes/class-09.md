# Stacks and Queues
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
## Common terminology for a stack :
* push : 
    * Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
* pop : 
    * Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. 
    * When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
* top : 
    * the top of the stack
* peek 
    * When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack
    * When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
* isEmpty : 
    * returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
## stack concepts :
### FILO 
first in last out : means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.
### LIFO : 
last in first out : means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

### Push O(1)
you push it into the stack by assigning it as the new top, with its next property equal to the original top.
### Pop O(1)
* removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.
* you would check isEmpty before conducting a pop. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.
### Peek O(1)
* you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.
* Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a peek.
### IsEmpty O(1)
* returns a boolean that indicates if a stack is empty or not.
## Queue
* Enqueue 
    * Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
* Dequeue 
    * Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. 
    * If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
* Front  
    * This is the front/first Node of the queue.
* Rear 
    * This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
* Peek 
    * When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. 
    * If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
* IsEmpty 
    * returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
## Queues concepts :
### FIFO
First In First Out : the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

### LILO
Last In Last Out :the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.

### Enqueue O(1)
add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n);
### Dequeue O(1)
remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.
### Peek O(1)
* you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

* Typically, you want to check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.
### IsEmpty O(1)
* returns a boolean that indicates if a queue is empty or not.
