# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda
## Review, Research, and Discussion
* What are serverless functions?
    * needs a server but you don't have to write the back end : A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier.

* If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
    * using AWS Lambda cloud services: first we create a bucket with a unique name and then write the function and test it and select a trigger to run the code when it happens. 

* Describe how a CDN works
    * a CDN is a network of servers linked together with the goal of delivering content as quickly, cheaply, reliably, and securely as possible. In order to improve speed and connectivity, a CDN will place servers at the exchange points between different networks.

    * These Internet exchange points (IXPs) are the primary locations where different Internet providers connect in order to provide each other access to traffic originating on their different networks. By having a connection to these high speed and highly interconnected locations, a CDN provider is able to reduce costs and transit times in high speed data delivery.

    * Beyond placement of servers in IXPs, a CDN makes a number of optimizations on standard client/server data transfers. CDNs place Data Centers at strategic locations across the globe, enhance security, and are designed to survive various types of failures and Internet congestion.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
* Serverless Functions
    *  serverless functions are single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted on managed infrastructure.

* Cloud Storage
    * Cloud storage is a way for businesses and consumers to save data securely online so that it can be accessed anytime from any location and easily shared with those who are granted permission. Cloud storage also offers a way to back up data to facilitate recovery off-site.

* CDN
    * A content delivery network, or content distribution network, is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers.

### [AWS API Gateway Overview](https://www.serverless.com/amazon-api-gateway)
#### What is Amazon API Gateway?
* Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

* Many Serverless applications use Amazon API Gateway, which conveniently replaces the API servers with a managed serverless solution.



#### How does API Gateway work?
* API Gateway sits between the backend services of your API and your APIâ€™s users, handling the HTTP requests to your API endpoints and routing them to the correct backends. It provides a set of tools that help you manage your API definitions and the mappings between endpoints and their respective backend services. It can also generate API references from your definitions and make them available to your users as API documentation.

* API Gateway integrates with many other AWS services like AWS Lambda, AWS SNS, AWS IAM, and Cognito Identity Pools. These integrations allow for fully managed authentication and authorization layers, as well as detailed metrics and tracing for API requests.

### [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
* Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.

* API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out and, with the API Gateway tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales.
### [AWS DynamoDB Guide](https://www.dynamodbguide.com/what-is-dynamo-db/)
* DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers:

reliable performance even as it scales;
* a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
* a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.

DynamoDB is a particularly good fit for the following use cases:

* Applications with large amounts of data and strict latency requirements. As your amount of data scales, JOINs and advanced SQL operations can slow down your queries. With DynamoDB, your queries have predictable latency up to any size, including over 100 TBs!

* Serverless applications using AWS Lambda. AWS Lambda provides auto-scaling, stateless, ephemeral compute in response to event triggers. DynamoDB is accessible via an HTTP API and performs authentication & authorization via IAM roles, making it a perfect fit for building Serverless applications.

* Data sets with simple, known access patterns. If you're generating recommendations and serving them to users, DynamoDB's simple key-value access patterns make it a fast, reliable choice.

### [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It's a fully managed, multi-region, multi-active, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications. DynamoDB can handle more than 10 trillion requests per day and can support peaks of more than 20 million requests per second.
### [Dynamoose](https://dynamoosejs.com/getting_started/Introduction/)
Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose, which means if you are coming from Mongoose the syntax will be very familar.

#### Key Features
* Type safety
* High level API
* Easy to use syntax
* Ability to transform data before saving or retrieving documents
* Strict data modeling (validation, required attributes, and more)
* Support for DynamoDB Transactions
* Powerful Conditional/Filtering Support
* Callback & Promise support
