## How to Solve Programming Problems
### Common mistakes
1. improper allocation of time.
2. try to start writing code as soon as possible
3. trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration
### A simple set of steps
1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

### Read the problem completely twice

completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.
> If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.

**solve the problem manually first**<br>
**use a Mathematical Induction approach if possible.**<br>
**write out all the things you are normally storing in your head**
### Optimize the manual solution
figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.
### Write pseudo-code or comments
*  you can skip this step if you have a really good handle on the problem or your previous steps already created a detailed enough description of the solution that coding it is already a 1 to 1 translation
### Replace comments with real code
take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.<br>

If you struggle here, there are usually two possible reasons:

1. You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps
2. You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion
### Optimize the real code
make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names.

## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive
### what if you placed a high value on your time?
Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.
### “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness
If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month.
> “The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”
### Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy
For world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters.<br>
Deep work means absolutely not tolerating distractions and producing monumental quality and quantity in a very short time. This is how you can complete far more with focused efforts than unfocused efforts with far more time.
### As You Think, So You Are
If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.
But if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.
f you don’t treat yourself and your time with respect, you will become unhappy, resentful, and tired. Your body and mind long for mastery and freedom; you can’t have those things if your time is cheap and easily taken.
### You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them
Every time you say yes to something, it means you’re saying “no” to a dozen other opportunities. The world’s most successful and extraordinary people say no to almost everything, but yes to a few things.
Really successful people say no to most things, because most things won’t get them to where they truly want to be.

## How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving
### Why is this important?
Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):

1. Try a solution.
2. If that doesn’t work, 
try another one.
3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.
### Have a framework
#### 1. Understand
Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).
#### 2. Plan
In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
#### 3. Divide
Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.
Do not try to solve one big problem.
Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).
#### 4. Stuck?
* Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
* Reassess:  Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach? 
* Research:No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. do this even if you solved the problem!
#### Practice
Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

## 5 Whys : Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly
Stubborn or recurrent problems are often symptoms of deeper issues.
* "Quick fixes" may seem convenient, but they often solve only the surface issues and waste resources that could otherwise be used to tackle the real cause.
### Origins of the 5 Whys Technique
Sakichi Toyoda, the Japanese industrialist, inventor, and founder of Toyota Industries, developed the 5 Whys technique in the 1930s. It became popular in the 1970s, and Toyota still uses it to solve problems today.
### When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis
You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.
* It may not be suitable if you need to tackle a complex or critical problem.
### How to Use the 5 Whys
#### 1. Assemble a Team
Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.
#### 2. Define the Problem
Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. 
#### 3. Ask the First "Why?"
Ask your team why the problem is occurring
answering it requires serious thought
#### 4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.

#### Step 5. Know When to Stop
You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further.
#### 6. Address the Root Cause(s)
Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.
#### 7. Monitor Your Measures
Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem.
