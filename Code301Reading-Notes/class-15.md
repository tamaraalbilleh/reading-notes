# When Women Stopped Coding
A lot of computing pioneers — the people who programmed the first digital computers — were women.
And for decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men.
The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.
As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.
