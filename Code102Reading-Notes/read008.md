## Contrast
* When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
## Opacity
> opacity
CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity)
